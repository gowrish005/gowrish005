# üí´ About Me:
I'm currently working on:<br><br>Multiple websites, with a focus on backend development. I‚Äôm learning frontend only as needed to complement my backend work.<br>I'm looking to collaborate on:<br><br>Web development or Android development projects.<br>I'm currently learning:<br><br>Java: Completed OOP concepts and currently diving into full-stack development using Spring Boot. I've solved over 1,000 questions on CodeChef, which has solidified my problem-solving skills.<br>Python: Completed OOP concepts and currently learning full-stack development with Flask. I've built various small-scale projects in the past, although many were not preserved.<br>MySQL: Proficient with nearly all concepts, from SELECT statements to advanced JOINs and UNIONS. I‚Äôve solved over 200 questions on platforms like HackerRank and secured 3rd place in my college‚Äôs 'Query Storm 2k24' competition.<br>Unreal Engine: Familiar with the basics and intend to explore it further in the future once academic commitments allow.<br>Android Development using Android Studio: Have basic knowledge, and plan to revisit it for deeper learning post-academics.<br>AWS Certification: Currently pursuing AWS certification via Udemy.<br>Ask me about:<br><br>Computer Hardware: I‚Äôm an expert in computer hardware, having fixed and worked on over 200 computers through freelancing services and my college.<br>Fun Fact:<br><br>I founded a startup called Hell Craft Network, where I served as CEO for over a year. It was a Minecraft server network that hosted modes like Survival, Bedwars, and Parkour. Despite the valuable experience I gained in managing the project, the server was discontinued due to low player engagement and revenue challenges. Through this journey, I developed strong insights into server management and DevOps principles, albeit not in the traditional sense.
